Sing me a song is an API to recommend songs anonymously.<br>
The more people like a recommendation, the more likely it is to be recommended to others. 


### ðŸ”¹ðŸ”¹About

This is the API that works with an application where people can send an old exam and search for old exams by teacher or by subject. Below are the implemented features:

- Adds a new music recommendation ***(/recommendations)***;
- Adds a point to recommendation score ***(/recommendations/:id/upvote)***;
- Removes a point to recommendation score ***(/recommendations/:id/downvote)***; <br>
  Based on business logic: if the score falls below -5, the recommendation must be deleted.
- Takes a random recommendation ***(/recommendations/random)***; <br>
  Based on business logic: 70% of the time: a song with a score greater than 10 should be randomly recommended and 30% score between -5 and 9.
- Lists the songs with the highest score and their score ***(/recommendations/top/:amount)***;

### ðŸ”¹ðŸ”¹Disclaimer

On this project I was training Typescript for the very first time. <br>
It was very challenging, but the final result is great. <br>
âž” Next step here is to add routes that select and recommend songs by genre. <br>
âž” Also, I will fix fix integration tests adding tests for expected arrays. <br>
